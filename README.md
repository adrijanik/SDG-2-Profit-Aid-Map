#### Linking Profits to Aid - Exploratory Visualization

We attempted to map the link between profits of companies and funds that goes to main organisations fighting hunger WFP, FAO, IFAD.

Assumptions and oversimplifications:
MNCs such as Nestle pays taxes in many different countries, e.g. Nestle pays 3,5 billion (2023) francs to Switzerland while total taxes paid are 13,1 billion franc (https://www.nestle.com/sustainability/responsible-business/tax-management-strategy).

There are multiple organisations that try to alleviate hunger WFP, FAO, and IFAD are just prominent examples but do not represent the entirety of the scene. Also countries pay at the EU level to some organisations which is not accounted for. Initial idea was to measure how quantified aid towards Zero Hunger is in comparison to the profits of the leading companies in the food industry.

Study has limitations, but shows potential for an in-depth analysis.
